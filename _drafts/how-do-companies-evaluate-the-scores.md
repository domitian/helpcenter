# How do companies evaluate the scores?

eLitmus uses an artificial intelligent (AI) engine which uses extremely complex algorithms. The objective is to ensure candidates find jobs by being rejected in minimum number of places and that companies find talent which actually performs on the job.  
  
  
The success of the AI engine can be gauged from the fact that for every 3 candidates who attend selection process of a company through eLitmus, one gets offered.  
  
  
For every job, eLitmusâ AI engine assigns a rank to each student based on preferences and job profile set by the companies. So it is possible that you might be ranked higher than your friend in company âAâ but in company âBâ your friend is ranked higher despite having a lower score. This could be because Company A is engaged in R&D and hence gives higher weightage to individuals who have solved questions related to following skills â out of box thinking, algorithmic thinking, simplification, relational thinking, encapsulation and abstraction. Company B might be engaged in providing software services work or QA work. And hence will give higher weightage to individuals who have solved questions related to following skills â methodical approach, eye for detail, perseverance, patience etc.  
  
  
To illustrate this further - in a cricketing skills test, Sachin Tendulkar might score better than Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the overall level, but when the vacancy is for wicket keeper â Dhoni will be ranked higher given he has more wicket keeping experience. Similarly if a team seeks an opening batsman they would tend to prefer Sachin.  
  
  
Apart from these, some companies might have additional preference on basis of Geography and Academic credentials (for example: candidates from a particular state or candidates with above 65% throughout or candidates from certain colleges etc)
