# Can I cancel pH test once I have made payment?

No. Once we have received the payment, our system would automatically allocate a seat for you in the test location. Cancellation of the same is not possible, however you could reschedule your pH test to a future date for a maximum of three times and within 3 months from the date of your first pH test date or DD received date which ever is later.
