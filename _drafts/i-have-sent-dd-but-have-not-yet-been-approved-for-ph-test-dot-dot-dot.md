# I have sent DD but have not yet been approved for pH test...

There could be three possible scenarios:  
a) Your DD has not been received (Please do budget sufficient time for mail delivery).  
b) The required information/details (Registration Id etc) were not/wrongly entered.  
c) The DD is not payable to 'eLitmus Evaluation Pvt Ltd'/not payable at Bangalore.  
  
  
Note: If your test application is not approved at the latest 48 hours before the applied test date, then write to us query@elitmus.com
