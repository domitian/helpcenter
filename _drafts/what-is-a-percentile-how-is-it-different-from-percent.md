# What is a percentile? How is it different from percent ?

Lot of candidates confuse percentile to percent. They are vastly different and a brief explanation is below.  
  
  
Let us assume, Ram has scored 80th percentile in pH test. It means 80% of pH test takers have scored less than him and 20% people more than him. Say there are 100000 test takers in an year. So 20% of candidates that is 20,000 in all are above Ram.
