# How can I change my final percentage?

You need to fill out the details in the Discrepancy form which you will find with the Admit card. You can hand over the filled form when you appear for your pH test at your pH test center or come down to our Bangalore office and submit the same.  
In case you have already taken up the test, please call us on our support number (+91-7259 104 794) to get the test venue 2 working days before the test date.
