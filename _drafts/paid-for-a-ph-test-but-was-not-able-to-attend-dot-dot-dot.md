# Paid for a pH test but was not able to attend...

In case you were unable to attend the pH test despite of having received an admit card, you will be eligible to get a discount code of **Rs.500** .  
 The code will be enabled in your eLitmus account within a week of the pH test you have applied.  
 You can use the discount code to pay part of the test fee for the next pH test.  
To use the code, login to your elitmus account and apply for another pH test within the next two test dates. Go to Tests ->My Tests and click on the link âApply a scholarship codeâ and enter the code in the space provided. This will redeem that voucher and you will be able to take up the exam at Rs. 250. You can pay the balance amount by Cash/DD/Online.
