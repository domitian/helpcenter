# Can I reschedule pH test? How?

Yes. You can reschedule your test to a different **available date** , before the **<u>Last Date to Reschedule</u>** . You cannot reschedule a test after this date.  
To reschedule, log in to your account and Go to _Tests-> My Tests_ and click on the link -> _<u>Reschedule</u>_.  
You can either  
a) Change the Test Location:(depending on availability at the new location and before the last date of reschedule)  
b) Date of test: (depending on availability on the new date and before the last date of reschedule)  
  
  
At the maximum, three reschedules are permissible.
