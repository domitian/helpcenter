# When will I get a response after applying to companies?

When you apply to a company for a particular vacancy, your pH-scores and your online profile is made visible to the company. Thereafter the transaction is between you and the company. The response time for your application would depend on the companyâs urgency in hiring and the number of applications they have received.  
  
  
Your status will be updated under the "Interviews" section in your elitmus account whenever a company shortlists you.
