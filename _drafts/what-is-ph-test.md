# What is pH test?

pH test is an analytical and algorithmic thinking test and it evaluates job seekers on a variety of parameters, and grades them nationwide using an advanced statistical model, resulting in a pH score for each candidate.  
In addition to this, the test score gives one access to some of the most exclusive companies in India. So far eLitmus has served as an evaluation partner for over 200 companies.
