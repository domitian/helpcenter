# I have back in last semester. Can I take pH test?

In the pH test center it is mandatory to show the original mark sheets (we do not accept Photo copies/attested copies) of your graduation. In case you fail to produce those, your score will be kept on HOLD till you verify them with us. So we suggest you to take the test after clearing all your backlogs/arrears.
