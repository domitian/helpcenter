# How do I pay pH test fee? and How much?

The test fees is Rs. 750  
There are three ways you can use to pay the test fee:  
(1) Online -> If you have a credit card or online banking facility, you can pay the test fee online.  
(2) Demand Draft ->You could send a demand draft drawn in favor of "eLitmus Evaluation Private Limited" and payable at Bangalore. You need to mention your Name and Registration Id on the backside of the DD.  
(3) By Cash-> We accept cash only in our Bangalore office. Candidates need to get their pH test registration id.
