Companies typically shortlist students for interview calls on basis of the skill sets required for the job profile.  
  
  
For every job, eLitmusâ AI engine assigns a rank to each student based on preferences and job profile set by the companies. So it is possible that you might be ranked higher than your friend in company âAâ but in company âBâ your friend is ranked higher despite having a lower score.  
  
  
This could be because Company A is engaged in R&D and hence gives higher weightage to individuals who have solved questions related to following skills â out of box thinking, algorithmic thinking, simplification, relational thinking, encapsulation and abstraction. Company B might be engaged in providing software services work or QA work. And hence will give higher weightage to individuals who have solved questions related to following skills â methodical approach, eye for detail, perseverance, patience etc.
