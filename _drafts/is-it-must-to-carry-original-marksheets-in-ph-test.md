# Is it must to carry original marksheets in pH test?

Yes, it is mandatory to carry the originals of all the marksheets to the pH test center. We do not verify Xerox/attested copies of the same.  
In case you fail to produce the originals, your score will be "Withheld" until you get it verified by us.  
You can either come down to our Bangalore office to show them or can take it to your nearest pH test center when the next test takes place.  
We will be releasing the score within 15 working days after the verifications.  
  
  
**Note:** You have to carry a copy of your admit card when you come for verification.
