# I am 2008/2009  batch fresher. Can eLitmus help me?

eLitmus is fresher evaluation body hence a majority of the companies hiring through us will look for candidates with 0-2 years of experience.  
 Hence candidates passing out from the current batch are preferred over candidates from previous batches.
