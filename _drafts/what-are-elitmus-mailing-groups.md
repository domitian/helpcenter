# What are eLitmus mailing groups ?

Given that there are over half a million pH Score holders today, it is NOT possible to send individual mailer to all of you every time there is an opportunity.  
  
  
Hence eLitmus maintains mailing groups. The mailing groups are powered by googlegroups. The owner of the group (in this case eLitmus) sends a mail to the googlegroup. Google in turn forwards this mail to all individuals who have opted to receive the mail.  
  
  
**Note:**  
You need to join the group in order to receive the mails. To understand how to join any of our groups, read the article "How to join eLitmus mailing groups?"
