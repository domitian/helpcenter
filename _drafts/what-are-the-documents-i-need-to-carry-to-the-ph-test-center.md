# What are the documents I need to carry to the pH test center ?

You will have to bring following document in **ORIGINAL** :  
  
  
1) Xth, XIIth, Graduation/Post graduation marksheets (Final year students need to carry the marks sheets available till date).  
  
  
2) Government issued Photo identity card (like Driving license, passport, Voter Id card etc).  
  
  
3) eLitmus Admit Card with photo pasted.  
  
  
Your pH Test score will be withheld if the above credentials are not verified at the time of test.  
  
  
Additionally, any mismatch of details you provided at the time of registration and that during verification can be corrected by filling the discrepancy column in the admit card at test cente.
